# BIOSTAT823_FALL21_Final_Project


Final project instructions
Final projects are due by 11:59 PM 22 Nov, 2021.

Note: You are free to revise any of the entries below, so don't be constrained by what you wrote if it does not work out. For example, you might change the data science objective, change the technology stack used, etc - if doing so would improve the project outcome.

The dates given below are guides, but evidence of regular, incremental progress on the project will be considered in the final grade.

Each group will be asked to make class presentations on their project between 15-22 Nov 2021.


Suggested timeline
Start by 27 Sep - 8 weeks before deadline
Form a team


- The specific data sets you will be working with
- The objective of the project and how it benefits the target consumer
- What is the data product(s) that will be generated? For example, the project can generate one or more of the following
- Report (e.g. auto-generated PDF)
- Dashboard
- Online ML algorithm
- App
- Other


A sketch of the data science plan, which may include (if appropriate)
- Data plan (Extract, Load, Transform)
- ML plan (Model training, evaluation, selection, deployment, monitoring)
- Operations plan (workflow orchestration, CI/CD, containerization, serverless, testing, packaging, logging)
- Technology stack (databases, python packages, cloud platform)
- Roles, responsibilities and timed milestones for each team member
- Plan for accountability but be willing to help out team members
- Ask team members for help if you are overwhelmed
- Do the research and necessary work as planned

- Perform a branch and merge operation to fix a bug or add a feature
- Contribute something to another team's project by forking and submitting a pull request


8 Nov 2021 - 2 weeks before deadline
- Generate and review data product
- Final optimizations
- Revise team project README page
- Write personal blog
- Prepare for class presentation


Project instructions

For the final project, you will choose a data set(s) from the following topics

COVID-19
ICU admission
UK BioBank
From a team of 3-4 people. Each team will need to do the following:

- Identify and frame data science problem to solve given the data (data analyst/domain expert)
- Process and manage the data so that it is easily accessible (data engineer)
- Develop the analysis, modeling and reporting data product (data scientist / machine learning engineer)
- Each group member will also have to do the following individual task:

Write a post on GitHub-pages about the project and what you learned from doing this
Note: 80% of the grade will be based on the quality of the project as a whole (team effort); 20% will be based on teh quality of the blog/report (individual effort).

You should use the project to showcase the following skill sets
- Basic skills
- Effective use of version control
- Ideally, showcase branch and merge skills for concurrent feature development / bug fixes
- Literate programming
- Functional coding style
- Domain knowledge
- Introduction of domain concepts necessary to understand the data set(s)
- Framing the data science challenge

Data management
- Use of different data formats
- Use of SQL and/or NoSQL databases
- Data analysis and visualization
- Data cleaning and validation
- Use of linked data sources if applicable
- Attractive and easy-to-understand reports and/or dashboards

Development of data product
- This is often a predictive machine learning model (classical or deep)
- Construct pipeline, perform model training, evaluation and selection
- Other data products can also be developed (in place of or in addition to supervised learning) if more appropriate for your problem
- Examples - unsupervised or self-supervised models, graphical models, complex interactive visualizations

Operationalization
- Testing, logging, monitoring, streaming, packaging if applicable
- Use of distributed computing platform if applicable
- Deployment to cloud platform (including serverless if applicable)
